Yab
===
yab is a complete BASIC programming language for Haiku. It allows fast prototyping with simple and clean code. yab contains a huge amount of BeAPI specific commands for GUI and much, much more.

yab wouldn't be complete without the yab-IDE, a powerful development environment, which of course is programmed in yab itself.

The BuildFactory allows you to recompile and bind your yab program with the yab interpreter as one stand-alone program.

Furthermore, several examples and documentation give you a fast introduction to yab.

The new Localizer makes localization easy. It also supports old ZETA locale files.

Compiling
---------------------
Just run `make` in `src`.
