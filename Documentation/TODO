ToDo

Features:
- LPT and COM signal send/receive, specific request by lorglas
- Layout

Bugs:
- drop file bug ide
- strings cannot handle chr$(0)
- TEXTEDIT selection somehow buggy, seems to be a Haiku issue
- SOUND commands don't work because of a missing API call in Haiku
- printing seems to be broken (further testing needed)
